Battleship
Areas of focus
TDD
Object oriented
Expectations
You are building a playable game of battleship
We want both a command line version (first)and a web version based on  one backend.
* Beginner = 12x12 grid, 2-unit boat, 3-unit boat, 4-unit boat, 5-unit boat
* Intermediate = 24x24 grid, 2-unit boat, 3-unit boat, 4-unit boat, 5-unit boat
* Advanced = 36x36 grid, 2-unit boat, 3-unit boat, 4-unit boat, 5-unit boat
Allow player to choose their level of play 
Ask player to enter coordinates for ships Example A1,A3
Note
* Ships cannot wrap around the board
* Ships cannot overlap
* Ships can be laid horizontally or vertically
* Coordinates must correspond to the first and last units of the ship. (IE: You can’t place a two unit ship at "A1 A3")
Game flow
Once ships are laid out it is time to move on to the player shoot sequence
The game should show the player a map with coordinates listed on top and side of grid
Ask the player to make a guess of the opponents ships
* If the coordinate has already been shot at, reject the guess and ask them to shoot again
* If the coordinate misses the opponent ships, mark it with an O on the map.
* If the coordinate "hits" an opponent ship, mark it with an H on the map and enter the Hit Ship sequence below
Then switch to the enemy shoot sequence
Example Where XX and YYY represent the player’s ships.
* The computer player randomly selects a location which has not been shot at and shoots at it.
* If the shot misses the player ships, mark it with a M on the map.
* If the shot "hits" a player ship, mark it with an H on the map and enter the Hit Ship sequence
Then move to the Player Shoots sequence.
Hit Ship Sequence
* If the hit did not sink the ship, tell them that they hit an enemy ship
* If the hit sunk the ship, tell them they sunk it and the size of the ship.
* If the hit sunk the ship and it was the last enemy ship, then enter the End Game sequence
End Game Sequence
When either the player or computer wins the game…
* Output a sorry/congratulations message
* Output how many shots it took the winner to sink the opponent’s ships
* Output the total time that the game took to play
